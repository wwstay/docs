# Welcome to WWStay API documentation

WWStay has two avatars.  In one, we are a fast-growing
global company specializing in corporate &amp; business
travel.  In the other, we are building a modern, travel
infrastructure for the internet.  Here, we talk of the latter.

Accomodation (hotel, apartments, etc) has too many problems
that companies solve again and again.  Several of these
existing solutions have also not kept pace with other technological
changes like cloud, mobile, etc.  So we are building a
modern, API based platform ground-up for today's world.

Some of the principles we will promise are -

* A [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
based system
* Our API's are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and
to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. 
* [JSON](http://json.org/) will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors 
* [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) will be used to encrypt all data and our APIs work
only over https

## Components

The key components used to interact with our systems are the following

* **[Search](search/search.md)** - Search APIs enables you to easily search for, and book properties globally
 according to your specified search requirements.

* **[Dashboard](pa.md)** - Dashboard APIs gives access to your requests, reservations, invoices, reports, etc.
